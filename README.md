## Double Linked List [Rust Practice]
An implementation of a doubly-linked list data structure written in Rust. This project was mostly made because I failed to implement a "safe" version of a doubly linked list *without* using reference counting to learn the language. It was my first short concrete project where I used the **unsafe** keyword and unsafe blocks. It worked as practice as well as helped me get a feeling for how Rust's "unsafe" elements' allow for C-style design without needing to call external C libraries. In addition, using unsafe blocks for operations where all unsafe conditions can be checked previous to code execution simplifies implementing ubiquitous operations in a performant way.
